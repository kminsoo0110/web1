  <p>Rise follows many of the new conventions for the series introduced through World while introducing new features, including a new animal companion called a Palamute that can be used to ride across the map or into battle, and the use of Wirebugs to traverse the game world vertically and mount and ride certain monsters in the game. The game received generally positive reviews upon release.</p>
